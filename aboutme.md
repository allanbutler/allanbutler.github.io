My name is Allan Butler. I do/am a Data Scientist at [H-E-B](https://www.heb.com). I work mostly in Spark, Python, SQL, and R. I enjoy public transportation, long walks to the fridge, and building end-to-end data solutions. Please use my [calendy](https://calendly.com/allandbutler/30min?) if you would like to schedule a call.
