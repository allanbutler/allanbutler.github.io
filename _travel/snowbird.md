Nestled within the majestic Cottonwood Canyon, Snowbird Mountain Resort offers an unparalleled snowboarding experience for enthusiasts seeking thrill and tranquility amidst its snowy slopes. My recent journey began with a stroke of luck, finding parking on the side of the canyon road in front of Gadzoom, setting the stage for an unforgettable day on the mountain.

But before that, my first stop was at [Utah Ski & Golf](https://www.utahskigolf.com/) for my board and gear. Visiting from out of town with no winter sports gear they fit me right up.


## Starting Point: Gadzoom Lift
Our adventure kicked off at Gadzoom, where the excitement of the day ahead bubbled as we prepared to explore the vastness of Snowbird's terrain.

## Exploring the Slopes:

Our first conquest was a blue trail that led us to the Little Cloud lift, offering a gateway to the mountain's more secluded paths. We ventured through Fields Cut Off, embracing the thrill of the ride up Little Cloud. The journey continued as we played around on the Road to Provo, finding ourselves amidst the exhilarating Rasta Chutes.

Not satisfied with just one round, we took Little Cloud again, this time setting our sights on Regulator Johnson to Gad Chutes. The morning's adventures worked up an appetite, leading us to a well-deserved lunch at the Mid Gad Restaurant, a perfect spot to refuel and relish in the morning's escapades.

Post-lunch, we embarked on a journey through the Peruvian Tunnel, emerging into the Mineral Basin. Despite the low to zero visibility, Hamilton Cliffs offered a playground like no other, with each turn and drop adding to the day's excitement. Our pursuit of adventure didn't stop there; we ascended Baldy, indulging in its inviting blue runs before making our way up to Hidden Peak. The Summit Restaurant at the peak became a brief respite, offering breathtaking views and a moment of relaxation before descending back to the car.

## A Path Less Traveled:
One of the day's highlights was discovering a path leading towards Alta, specifically designed for skiers at the top of Mineral Basin, presenting a unique opportunity to explore beyond Snowbird's boundaries.
