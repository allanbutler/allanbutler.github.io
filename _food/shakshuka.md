Figure 1.1 Shakshuka fresh off the stove.

Shakshuka originated as a breakfast for workers in North Africa but is now popular throughout the Middle East. Shakshuka can be enjoyed as a brunch food or even a dinner. This recipe favors a bold tomato and red pepper sauce and features a harissa or curry paste as its distinguishing ingredient.

## Tips

* A cast iron is preferred but large lidded skillet will do.
* Adjust time on eggs based on how runny you prefer the yolk.

This meal provides around 4 servings of shakshuka.

## Directions

1. Heat the oil over medium heat in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet. If you do not own a cast-iron, a regualr 12-inch steel pan works great. Add the red pepper, salt, and several grinds of fresh pepper and cook around 4 to 6 minutes.

2. Lower the heat to medium-low and add the garlic, paprika, cumin, and cayenne. Stir around 30 seconds, then add the tomatoes and harissa or curry paste. Simmer for 15 minutes until the sauce is thickened.

3. Add the chopped spinach and stir until wilted. Make small wells for the amount of eggs you will be using, 4 to 5. Cover the skillet and cook until the eggs are set, 5 to 8 minutes. The length of time will depend on how runny you like your egg yolks.

4. Season with salt and pepper to taste and lastly add the feta, parsley, avocado, if using. Serve with toasted bread for scooping.
