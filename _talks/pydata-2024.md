[Why Your Machine Learning Model's Probabilities Are Lying to You: A Guide to Probability Calibration](https://nyc2024.pydata.org/cfp/talk/TUUBPD/) is a deep dive into the often-overlooked aspect of machine learning modelsâ€”probability calibration. This talk will reveal why the probabilities produced by your models may be misleading, how this can impact decision-making, and what you can do to fix it. Attendees will leave with a solid understanding of probability calibration techniques and their practical applications in real-world scenarios.
